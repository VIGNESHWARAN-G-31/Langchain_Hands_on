# ðŸ¦œðŸ”— LangChain Hands-on Repository

Welcome to the **LangChain Hands-on** repository!  
This is a **practical learning space** where we explore **LangChain**, a framework for building intelligent AI applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).  
It contains **step-by-step experiments**, **code examples**, and **mini-projects** designed to help beginners and enthusiasts understand how to create **AI agents, tools, and workflows**.

## ðŸ“Œ Why This Repo Exists

LLMs like  **Google Gemini** are powerful but often limited to answering single prompts.  
LangChain bridges this gap by enabling:
- Multi-step reasoning
- Tool integration (search, APIs, databases, etc.)
- Agents that decide *what to do next*
- Access to both structured and unstructured data

This repository is the result of **hands-on learning** â€” breaking down concepts and building small working projects to master LangChain.
